/*
Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. For example, + is an operator used for addition, while - is an operator used for subtraction.

Operators in C++ can be classified into 6 types:

    Arithmetic Operators
    Assignment Operators
    Relational Operators
    Logical Operators
    Bitwise Operators
    Other Operators

Arithmetic operators
+ Addition

* Multiplication
/ Division
% Modulus

7 + 2 = 9
7 - 2 = 5
7 * 2 = 14
7 / 2 = 3
7 % 2 = 1

7/2 is 3
7.0 / 2 is 3.5
7 / 2.0 is 3.5
7.0 / 2.0 is 3.5

num++;  // 6
// decrement operator
--num;  // 4
num--;  // 4

/*
Logical Operator
Suppose,
a = 5
b = 8

Then,

(a > 3) && (b > 5) evaluates to true
(a > 3)  && (b < 5) evaluates to false

(a > 3) || (b > 5) evaluates to true
(a > 3) || (b < 5) evaluates to true
(a < 3) || (b < 5) evaluates to false

!(a < 3) evaluates to true
!(a > 3) evaluates to false
